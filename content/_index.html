          <h4 id="seamless-security">Container-native Security</h4>
          <p>By providing each container with its own user-space kernel, gVisor
          provides protection against privilege escalations while still integrating
          seamlessly with popular container orchestration systems, such as Docker and
          Kubernetes. This includes support for advanced features, such as a volumes,
          terminals and sidecars.

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h4 id="resource-efficiency">Resource Efficiency</h4>
          <p>Containers are efficient because workloads of different shapes and sizes
          can be packed together by sharing host resources. By using host native
          abstractions such as threads and memory mappings, gVisor closely co-operates
          with the host to enable the same resource model as native containers.
          Sandboxed containers can safely and securely share host resources with each
          other and native containers on the same system.

          <h4 id="platform-portability">Platform Portability</h4>
          <p>Modern infrastructure spans multiple clouds and data centers, often using
          a mix of virtualized instances and traditional servers. The pluggable
          platform architecture of gVisor allows it to run anywhere, enabling security
          policies to be enforced consistently across multiple environments.
          Sandboxing requirements need not dictate where workloads can run.
